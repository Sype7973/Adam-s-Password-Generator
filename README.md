# Adam-s-Password-Generator

## Description


- My motivation was to create a random password generate that uses, numbers, letters (upper/lower case) and special characters to generate a unique password
- I built this project to put the javascript knowledge i had learn't to practice and create a functiona password generate that utilised javascript logic
- The password generator is able to create a password between 8-128 characters using numbers, letters and special characters. It would be a functional unique login method which would solve any security issues for a company needing to generate unique OTPs.
- I learn't that javascript can interact with html in many different ways and can act as the 'brain' of the HTML code


## Usage

Once you have clicked the "generate password" button; a prompt message will appear from the top. Confirm the length of your password and you will then be taken through confirm boxes to determine which criteria you would like for your password.
